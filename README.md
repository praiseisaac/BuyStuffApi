# BuyStuffApi
This is the API portion of a project I worked on for my Web Development class. The goal was to build an e-commerce website. Well, it is currently a far cry from being an e-commerce site, but I intend to work on it incrementaly until it is presentable. Turns out a week is not enough to build an e-commerce site. Who would have thunk it?
